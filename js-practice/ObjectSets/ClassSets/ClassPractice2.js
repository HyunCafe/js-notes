// 1) Basic Class Creation: Create a Person class that initializes with a name and age. Add a method greet that returns a greeting string using the name.

// 2) Inheritance: Extend the Person class to create an Employee class. The Employee class should have an additional property jobTitle and a method work that returns a string about their work.

// 3) Getters and Setters: Add a getter and a setter for the age property in the Person class to validate that the age is a positive number.

// 4) Static Methods: Create a class Calculator with static methods for basic operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Each method should take two numbers and return the result.

// 5) Encapsulation with Private Fields: Modify the Person class to make the name and age properties private. Provide public methods to get and set these properties safely.

// 6) Composition Over Inheritance: Create two classes Writer and Reader. Then create a BookClubMember class that composes these two classes without using inheritance.

// 7) Polymorphism: Create an abstract class Shape with a method area. Extend this class with specific shapes like Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, etc. Each subclass should override the area method to calculate its area.
